# glua-extensions

A collection of extensions, libraries and other useful snippets of code for Garry's Mod.

### Usage

For development simply clone (or download) the repo and install it as a legacy addon. It should load itself but if you need access to it in an earlier point (e.g. top-level gamemode code) then you can use `require("glua-extensions")` to force an early load.

For distribution it'll likely be a while before I'm considering a workshop upload (if at all) so instead your best course of action is to simply copy/paste the functions you need into your addon. It's messy but so are most things with Garry's Mod.
