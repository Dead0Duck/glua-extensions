# glua-extensions

A collection of extensions, libraries and other useful snippets of code for Garry's Mod.

### Usage

For development simply clone (or download) the repo and install it as a legacy addon. It should load itself but if you need access to it in an earlier point (e.g. top-level gamemode code) then you can use `require("glua-extensions")` to force an early load.

For distribution, servers can clone the addon directly from git as there's no assets involved. For workshop releases, bother me on discord (@tanknut) and I'll put it on there.
